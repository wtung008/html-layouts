    The Imbalance of Culture Fit</a></h3>
    <h4>by <a href="http://alistapart.com/author/mattgriffin">Matt Griffin</a>
    </h4>

  <p class="article1">
    Part of getting to a better place in the new year is recognizing where
    we have sway, and going past our own discomfort to create positive change
    in ourselves and in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring
    process can do better by thinking critically about culture fit. Matt
    Griffin challenges us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of
    team that’s the best for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us
    comfortable by surrounding us with people largely like ourselves in ways
    that aren’t relevant to the business.
